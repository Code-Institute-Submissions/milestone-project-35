# Adrian Laub Portfolio
Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is my very first portfolio website to test my new skills and to draw attention to potential clients.
My website should give a short impression of myself and offer a contact possibility. Since I live and work in Germany, the website should also be displayed in German.

# Team
* Author - Adrian Laub
* Mentor - Rhey Ann Magcalas

## Demo
You can find the live demo [here](https://lemon-squeezy.github.io/milestone-project-1/).

## UX
The design focuses on the use of a desktop PC or tablet. A smooth scroll effect has been implemented to ensure a pleasant viewing. A colorful background image was chosen, which was mirrored after each section. This allows a large, coherent picture to be simulated.
The viewer should be introduced on the home page with a design quote and my logo. In the About Section he can download my CV as a PDF.

## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.4.1)
4. Photoshop
5. Illustrator

## Features
This site uses the smooth or smart scroll effect which ensures a pleasant scroll behavior. The navbar is sticky and collapses on a smaller viewport.
* Home
There are no special features in this section. The user can see my brand logo.
* About
The user gets some information about me and is referred to a download link of my CV.
* Skills
In this section, the user sees my skills, these are graphically displayed with the progress bar.
* Contact
The user can use the contact form to write to me.

### Features Left to Implement
In the future, I would like to add a work section where I can show my newest project.

## Testing
The site was tested with the current most popular browsers and different devices (desktop, Ipad, Iphone X):
* Chrome;
* Edge/IE, (The smooth scroll effect doesn't work with the Edge Browser)
* Firefox,
* Opera,
* Safari.
The Contact form is not working so far, functionality will be added soon.

## Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch.

## Credits

### Content
All content in the About and My Skills sections in this site were written by me.
The progress bar in the My skills section was copied from the Code Institute resume project.
The contact form was also copied and slightly modified from the Code Institute resume project.

### Media
The background image was taken from pexels.com and modified with a black layer and opacity.
